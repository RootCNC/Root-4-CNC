# Root 4 CNC Large Scale 3D Printed CNC Machine
Root 4 is the successor to Root 3 CNC that was my main CNC for a number of years. In fact, there is nothing wrong with my Root 3 CNC (originally named Root 2.1) and it did all my CNC jobs!

Root 4 was designed to accommodate larger size 3D printed CNC machine and seeing we’re due to get married soon (Pending lockdown restrictions) – I thought it best to build a bigger one for all the custom wedding ideas we’ve got.

The Root 4 follows the core design methodology of simple, cheap, scalable and use common parts for it design. It has also taken inspiration from fellow Root CNC community members who have built their own large-scale 3D printed CNC machines. I do enjoy seeing what you do with these machines, so please consider dropping me an email or post a photo of your build and what you make with this machine.

 ## Key Changes
 A comparison of all the machine can be found on the home page [(LINK)](https://rootcnc.com/)
 1.  Uses 40x40mm Box section
2.  Natively supports balls screws
3.  Has an auto square functionality.
4.  Independent dust shoe.
5.  Stiffer design
6.  Larger working area.

Most of the parts have been tweak from the original Root 3 build but it all can be printed on a standard 200x200mm 3D printer.

## Working Area

    What is the working area of the Root 4 CNC Machine?

    What length of 40x40mm Box section do I required?

Please see this file: [Here](https://github.com/RootCNC/Root-4-CNC/blob/master/Working%20Area.xlsx)

For a comparison of **SFU1605 Ball screw length** VS **Box Section Length** VS **working area** (taking into account side panel thickness).

For my build I used 1500mm long ballscrew for both X and Y Axis with a total working area of **1204mm by 1190mm** (XY) with a Z travel of 158mm as standard. (Z-Axis is **not** user configurable)
